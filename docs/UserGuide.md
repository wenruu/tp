# ðŸ¦ˆ The Sharkives User Guide

The Sharkives is a **desktop application for managing loan records**, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still offering a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. If you can type fast, The Sharkives helps you manage loans, repayments, and outstanding debts **more efficiently** than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/releases)
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for The Sharkives.

4. Open a [command terminal](#glossary), `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar sharkives.jar` command to run the application. `cd` [quick guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=directories-changing-another-directory-cd-command).<br>
   A [GUI](#glossary) similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `loan 1 s 1000 10 2027-10-10` : Creates a new simple interest loan with 10% interest for a selected borrower.

    * `sort` : Sort borrowers by amount and order desc (default).

    * `list` : Lists all recorded borrowers and their loans.

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a borrower named John Doe to Sharkives.

    * `clear` : Deletes all borrower records.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.
   
> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Click anywhere on a client's "card" to get more analytics on their loans and loan details!
 
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

7. Alternatively, skip straight to our [Command Summary](#command-summary) to get started immediately!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order except for `loan` and `pay` commands.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Commands are case-sensitive unless specified otherwise.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

- **filter** can be used after **sort** (not in the same command) to filter and sort a list.

-  Invalid predicates will be accepted as input but will not do anything.
   - no valid predicates as input will show all loans as if without filter.
   - Valid predicates will be listed in the output.
   - Having other alphanumeric characters in your predicates which are seperated by spaces from the predicate will still allow your predicates to function as normal

</div>

**Format:** `filter [INDEX] pred/ PREDICATE pred/ PREDICATE...`

**Format:** `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`
- `KEYWORD` refers to the alphanumerical string to search. Note that the search is an exact match (i.e. `find Jak` will not include `Jake` in the displayed list).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">  
ðŸ’¡ Tips:

- **find** command is case sensitive
  > Example: `"find"` is **not** equal to `"FIND"`

- **find** splits the keywords by spacing and returns all people who's names match any keyword present in the keywords
- For example: `"find alex james"` will return `"Alex Oh"` and `"James Ho"`

### Saving the data

The data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

The data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, the app will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the app to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Sharkives home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Compound interest loan amount** can behave strangely when using a flexible payment schedule (i.e. payments made anytime instead of monthly)<br>
  a. As our algorithm assumes that the loanee will pay monthly for easier calculations, paying off-schedule can cause discrepancies in the remaining amount owed due to the way compound interest is calculated.<br>
  b. An update to this will be coming in future, where we will introduce a more sophisticated algorithm capable of calculating compound interest on a flexible repayment basis.
4. **When using sort**, currently there is no unsort feature. However, it is one of the future features we plan to implement.
5. The UI which displays monetary values may not always have accurate decimal placings, this is simply due rounding due to us forcing the display to be in 2dp.
